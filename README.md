Ethiopian Medical Businesses Data Warehouse

Project Overview

This project involves creating a data warehouse to store and analyze data scraped from various online sources, including Telegram channels, related to Ethiopian medical businesses. The purpose is to centralize medical business data for analysis, reporting, and decision-making purposes.

Project Objectives

Data Collection: Scrape data from multiple online sources (websites, Telegram).
Data Processing: Cleanse, transform, and structure the data for easy analysis.
Data Storage: Build a scalable data warehouse to store the collected data.
Data Analysis: Enable data analysis and generate insights on Ethiopian medical businesses.
Technologies Used.

This project further focuses on object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to identify and analyze medical tools from images sourced from the Chemed Telegram Channel. 

Additionally, an API is developed to facilitate data retrieval and interaction with the detection system. The extracted data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for further analysis and retrieval.

Web Scraping:python

Data Warehouse: PostgreSQL

Features Image Scraping & Preprocessing: Images are scraped from Telegram channels and stored in a structured format.

Object Detection: YOLO is used to detect and classify medical tools in images.

Logging & Monitoring: The pipeline includes logging to track processing steps and errors.
